  /* Computes a set of approximate minima of {f} in the box
    ({d}-dimensional interval) {xr[0] × xr[1] × ... × xr[d-1]}.

    The method used is the interval branch-and-bound, stopping when
    the sub-boxes have width less than {tol[i]} along coordinate {i},
    for every {i} in {0..d-1}.
    
    The function call {F(xs)} must return an interval {fs} that is
    guaranteed to contain the minimum value of {f(x)} for all points
    {x} in the box {xs[0..d-1]}. On output, the interval {fm} is set
    to the smallest known interval that is guaranteed to contain the
    minimum of {f} in the original box {xr}.
    
    The {report} procedure, if not NULL, is called with {final = FALSE} 
    for every sub-box generated by the branch-and-bound procedure, and
    also with {final = TRUE} for every box that is returned in the 
    result list. */

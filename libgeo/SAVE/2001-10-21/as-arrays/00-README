This is an old experimental version of "libgeo",
using "naked" arrays 

  typedef double r3_t [3];
  
whereas the current version uses arrays "dressed" as structs:

  typedef struct { double c[3]; } r3_t;
  
The former version produces shorter and cleaner code
({p[i]} instead of {p.c[i]}), but the latter seems to be 
more programmer-friendly --- e.g. allows functions 
returning an {r3_t}.

    Basic geometry routines, including linear algebra in {R^2},{R^3}, {R^4},
    {R^6} and {R^n}, matrix operations, Gaussian elimination.  
    Also some tools for homogeneous coordinates in {T^2}, {T^3} and {T^n},
    for integer tuples in {Z^2}, {Z^3}, and {Z^n}, for ellipse representations,
    for quadratic function optimization by the edge-divided simplex method.
    Also tools for parsing vector arguments from files or the command line.

    with depth-of-focus blur. All four images will have {NX} columns of
    {NY} pixels. The {sVal} image will have {NC} channels.
    
    The value of each pixel {pix} of the four images computed by taking
    a set of /sampoints/ (pixel sub-sampling points) on the image plane
    around the pixel's center, and tracing a number of rays through each
    sampoint {pSmp}, as determined by the {samp} parameter record. 
    
    The results of tracing these rays are combined as described under
    {multifok_raytrace_compute_point_properties} (q.v.) to produce the
    sampoint attributes {colr(pSmp)}, {vBlr(pSmp)} and {hAvg(pSmp)}. The
    procedure combines these values of all {NS} sample points {pSmp} of
    the pixel with weights {wSmp[0..NS-1]} to obtain the values of
    {colr(pix)}, {vBlr(pix)}, {hAvg(pix)}, and {hDev(pix)} at that
    pixel. The value of {vBlr(pix)} is augmented to account for
    the spread of the sampoints relative to the pixel's center.

    The values of {colr(pix)}, {hAvg(pix)}, and {hDev(pix)} are stored
    as the pixel values of the image {fr.sVal}. The value {vBlr(pix)} is
    converted to a sharpness indicator {shrp(pix) = 1/vBlr(pix)}, which
    is stored in the image {fr.shrp}.

    The fields {fr.zFoc} and {fr.zDep} are set to {zFoc} and {zDep}. The
    latter should be {+INF} for a sharp image (in which case {KR} should
    be 1). Otherwise the RMS spread of the ray directions will be one
    scene unit for each {zDep} of vertical distance from the sampling
    point.

    If {debug_pixel} is not null, it is called for every pixel in the
    image with the pixel indices {iPix}. If it returns true, the
    procedure prints detailed debugging information for the pixel with
    those indices. In that case, if {report_ray} is not {NULL}, the
    procedure also calls {report_ray} for every traced ray that
    contributed to that pixel's values. Also in that case, if
    {report_pixel} is not {NULL}, calls it once with the computed pixel
    properties. */

    scene or object with a set of {KR} rays {R[0..KR-1]} through {pObs}
    and averaging the results. Returns these values in
    {colr_pt[0..NC-1]}, {*vBlr_pt_P}, {*hAvg_pt_P}, and {*hVar_pt_P}.
    
    The direction {dir(R[r])} of each ray {R[r]} will be chosen
    internally with a Gaussian distribution of deviations from the mean
    direction {dRef}. As explained under {multifok_raytrace_proc_t}, the
    rays will start an infinite distance away from {pObs} in the
    direction opposite to {dir(R)}; therefore, hits that occur
    ``behind'' {pObs} will be considered as well as those that occur
    ``ahead'' of it.
    
    As a special case, if {zDep} is {+oo}, then {KR} must be 1, and the
    procedure will shoot a single ray {R[0]} from the point {pObs}, with
    direction {dir(R[0])=dRef}. This will result in "sharp" image, with
    no focus blur.
    
    The ray tracing is performed with
    {trace_ray(pRay,dRay,debug,&pHit,NC,colr)} where {pRay=pObs} is the
    starting point, and {dRay=dir(R)} is the unit-length ray direction
    vector (both in scene coordinates). The result is an {NC}-channel
    color value {colr(R)[0..NC-1]} and the scene coordinates of the hit
    point {pHit(R)}.

    The computed point color {colr(pObs)}, its blurring indicator
    {vBlr(pObs)}, and average height {hAvg(pObs)} will be be the average
    of the ray colors {colr(R[r]}}, blurring indicator {vBlr(R[r])}, and
    {hHit(R[r])} for {r} in {0..KR-1} The variance {hVar(pObs)} is the
    variance of the values {hHit(R[r])}. The value of {hDev(p)} is the
    deviation of {hVal(R)} over those rays.

    Let {vHit} be the vector {pHit(R)-pObs}. The height {hHit(R)} will
    be {zFoc} minus the projection of {vHit} along the direction {dRef},
    assumed to point perpendicular to the image plane and away from the
    camera. The tracing also produces a blurring indicator {vBlr(R)}
    which is the square of length of the projection of {vHit}
    perpendicular to {dRef}.
    
    The burring indicator {vBlr(pObs)} of the point will be zero if
    {zDep} is {+INF} or the sampoint {pObs} lies on the scene's surface.
    In this latter case, {hAvg} will be {zFoc} and {hVar} will be zero.
    
    If {debug} is true, also prints debugging infrormation, and, if
    {report_ray} is not {NULL}, also calls it with the ray data.
    The parameters {iPix,iSmp,step,wSmp} are used only for this purpose. */

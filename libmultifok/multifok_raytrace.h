  /* Creates a frame record {fr} with images {fr.sVal}, {fr.shrp}, {fr.hAvg},
    and {fr.hDev} by ray-tracing some generic scene or object with
    depth-of-focus blur. All four images will have {NX} columns of {NY} pixels.
    The {sVal} image will have {NC} channels.

    The value of each pixel {pix} of the four images is computed by
    taking a set of {NS} sample points on the image plane, displaced by
    {uSmp[0..NS-1]} from the center of {pix}. The procedure then traces
    a total of {NR} rays through these sample points with directions
    defined by the relative ray tilts {tRay[0..NR-1]} and the nominal
    depth-of-focus {zDep}. The number of rays {NR} must be an integer
    multiple of the number of sampling points {NS}; for each sampling
    point, the procedure will cast a disjoint subset of the rays with size 
    {KR=NR/NS}.  However, if {NR} is 1, it will use that single ray,
    assumed to be straight down ({tRay[0]=(0,0)}) for all sampling points,
    so {KR} will be 1.

    The result of tracing each ray {R} is an {NC}-channel color value
    {colr(R)[0..NC-1]} and the scene coordinates of the hit point
    {pHit(R)}. The ray tracing is performed with
    {trace_ray(pRay,dRay,debug,&pHit,NC,colr)} where {pRay =
    map_point(pSmp)} is the sampling point, {dRay} is the unit-length
    ray direction vector (both in scene coordinates), and {debug} is the
    result returned by {debug_pix(pix)}.

    Let {uRay} be the vector {pHit(R)-pSmp}. The height {zVal(R)} will
    be {zFoc} minus the projection of {uRay} along the direction {dRef},
    assumed to point perpendicular to the image plane and away from the
    camera. The tracing also produces a blurring indicator {vBlr(R)}
    which is the square of length of the projection of {uRay}
    perpendicular to {dRef}.

    The values {colr(pSmp)}, {vBlr(pSmp)} and {hAvg(pSmp)} are the
    averages of {colr(R)}, {vBlr(r)}, and {zVal(R)} over all the {KR}
    rays assigned to that sampling point, with the corresponding weights
    from {wRay[0..NR-1]}. The value of {Zdev(p)} is the weighted deviation
    of {zVal(R)} over those rays.

    Finally, the procedure combines these values of all {NS} sample points
    {pSmp} of the pixel with weights {wSmp[0..NS-1]} to obtain
    the values of {colr(pix)}, {vBlr(pix)}, {hAvg(pix)}, and {hDev(pix)}
    at that pixel. The value of {vBlr(pix)} is augmented with 1.0 to
    account for the fact that antialiasing (subsampling and averaging)
    causes some blurring.

    The values of {colr(pix)}, {hAvg(pix)}, and {hDev(pix)} are stored
    as the pixel values of the image {fr.sVal}. The value {vBlr(pix)} is
    converted to a sharpness indicator {shrp(pix) = 1/vBlr(pix)}, which
    is stored in the image {fr.shrp}.

    The fields {fr.zFoc} and {fr.zDep} are set to {zFoc} and {zDep}. The
    latter should be {+INF} if {NR} is 1, otherwise it should be inversely
    proportional to the mean spread of the ray directions {dRay}.

    For best results, both the ray tilts {tRay[0..NR-1]} and the
    sampling point displacements {uSmp[0..NS-1]} should be sorted
    by increasing distance from the origin {(0,0)}.

    If {debug_pixel} is not null, it is called for every pixel in the image
    with the pixel indices {iPix}. If it returns true, the procedure prints
    detailed debugging information for the pixel with those indices. In
    that case, if {report_ray} is not {NULL}, the procedure also calls
    {report_ray} for every traced ray that contributed to that pixel's
    values. */

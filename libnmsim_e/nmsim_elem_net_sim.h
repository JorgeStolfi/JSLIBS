    neurons during the time step from discrete time {t} to time
    {t+1}.
    
    On input, {V[i]} and {age[i]} must be the membrane potential and
    firing age of each neuron {i} at time {t}, for {i} in {0..nne-1};
    which defines its state at that time.
    
    On input, {M[i]} and {H[i]} must be the modulators of the output synaptic strength 
    and of the recharge factor of neuron {i} at time {t}, respectively, as determined from its 
    firing age {age[i]}.

    On input, {I[i]} must be the extra voltage increment that will be
    imposed on the potential of neuron {i} by external sources, in
    addition to the synaptic inputs from other neurons in the net,
    between times {t} and {t+1}.
    
    The {double} input variables cannot be {NAN}, and the ages must be 
    non-negative.
    
    On output, {X[i]} will be set to {TRUE} if the procedure decided that neuron {i} fired during
    that time step.
    
    On output, {J[i]} will have been set to the total
    input received by of neuron {i} between
    {t} and {t+1}; which is the external input {I[i]} plus the synaptic inputs
    from other neurons in the net. 
    
    On output, {V[i]} and {age[i]} will have been updated by the
    procedure to the simulated state of the neuron at time {t+1},
    according to the GL evolution recurrence. The modulators {M[i]}
    and {H[i]} will be updated too, to match the new {age[i]}.
    
    The input contents of {X} and {J} are ignored.
    
    If {etrace} is not {NULL}, the procedure also stores into it 
    the states and evolution dataof the selected neurons relevant to that time step. Specifically, let 
    {trk = etrace.trne[k]}, for each {k} in {0..etrace.nne-1},
    be the trace of a monitored neuron {i}.
    
    If {t} is in {trk.tlo .. trk.thi}, saves in the trace entry 
    {tst=trk.ts[t - trk.tlo]} corresponding to time {t} the parameters
    {V,age,M,H} that describe the state at time {t}, and the parametes
    {X,I,J} that describe what happened between times {t} and {t+1}.
    Note that the updated parameter {V,age,M,H} are NOT stored in the
    entry {t+1} of {trk}. */

/* COMPONENT EXTRACTION AND COMBINATION

  In the following procedures, {P} is a list of {np} potential patterns
  for {ne} electrodes.
  
  More precisely, {P} is a linearized array with {np} rows and {ne}
  columns, such that {P[ip*ne + ie]} is the value of electrode {ie} in
  pattern {ip}.
  
  The array {vin} must contain potentials for {nt} frames and {ne}
  electrodes. More precisely, the procedure assumes that {vin[it][ie]},
  is the potential of electrode {ie} in frame {it}, for {it} in
  {0..nt-1} and {ie} in {0..ne-1}.
  
  The array {Q}, when given, must be  a linearized matrix {Q} with {np} rows
  and {np} columns, which is the inverse of {P*P'} where {P'} is the
  transpose of {P}. */

    Returns the number {nv} of eigenvectors actually found, discarding
    those whose eigenvalues are less than {minMag^2}. This number
    will be between 0 and {ne}, inclusive.
    
    For {iv} in {0...nv-1}, the eigenvector number {iv} is stored in
    {Ev[iv*ne + je]} for {je} in {0..ne-1}. The square root of the
    corresponding eigenvalue is stored in {emag[iv]}. */

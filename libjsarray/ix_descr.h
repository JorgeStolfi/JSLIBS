    {ax[0..n-1]}, {ixB[kB] = ix[k]} for {kB} in {ax[0..n-1]}, where {k} is the

    after the call, is equivalent to using {r} and {r+s} before the call.
  
    Upon entry, requires {i != j} and {0 < D.sz[i] <= D.sz[j]}. The
    procedure reduces {D.sz[j]} by {D.sz[i]-1}, and adds {D.st[j]} to

    it will remain so.
    
    Thus, for example, if {D} is a {100О120О5} matrix, the call
    {ix_descr_diagonal(D,0,1)} will chop it down to a diagonal
    band, starting with the main diagonal and extending 21 elements to
    the right, indexed as a {100О21О5} matrix. */

  /* Evaluates the image {img} at the point {p = (x,y)}. The value is an
    average or integral of the values of samples of {img} around {p},
    using a pixel sampling kernel whose domain has been transformed by
    the Jacobian {J}. The result is returned in {v[0..chns-1]} where
    {chns=img->sz[0]}.
    
    The kernel weights are such that if {p} is stepped over a regular
    unit grid linearly mapped by the matrix {J}, the resulting kernels 
    form a partition of unity over the sample points. 
    
    If {avg} is true, the result is a weighted average of the samples in
    the kernel domain. This is appropriate, for example, it {img} is a
    digital photo.
    
    If {avg} is false, the result is simply the weighted sum
    of the sample values. This is appropriate, for example, it {img} is a 
    density distribution.
    
    The subsamples used to compute the result are interpolated in {img}
    using C0 bilinear interpolation (if {order} is 0) or C1 bicubic
    interpolation (if {order} is 1). Note that the latter may overshoot
    the interval {{0_1]}. 
    
    Any pixel index that falls outside its valid range {0..N-1} in {img} is
    reduced with {ix_reduce(i,N,red)}; if the result is {-1} the
    pixels are omitted from the average. */

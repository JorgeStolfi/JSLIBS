/* 
  A /procedural image/ is a function {func} that returns a float value
  {func(x,y)} for any {double} coordinates {x,y}. 

  When combining procedural images with a pixel array {A} of type
  {float_image_t}, the domain of the latter is assumed to be
  an axis-aligned rectangle {[0 _ NX] Ã— [0 _ NY]} of the plane
  {R^2}, where {NX = A->sz[1]} and {NY = A->sz[2]}.
  
  The pixel in row 0, column 0 of {A} is assumed to be adjacent to the
  origin. More generally, each pixel of {A} with indices {(x,y)} is
  conceptually a square with side 1, whose corners are {(x,y)} and
  {(x+1,y+1)}, and whose center is {(x+0.5,y+0.5)}. */

    pixel that may be affected by painting a figure whose real
    coordinates span the range from {z - r} to {z + r}. Takes into
    account that anti-aliasing effectivey enlarges each pixel by 1/2
    pixel all around.
    
    If {n} is not zero, the resulting range is clipped to the range
    {0..n-1}. If {*iLo > *iHi} on return, no pixels are affected. */

HANDLING GRADIENT NOISE

  Tried hard to find a good approximation for the 
  distribution of the azimuth of (x,y) when 
  (x,y) follow a symmetric 2D Gaussian distribution 
  with mean (0,d) and deviation 1 in each coordinate.

  See compute-polar-gaussian.gawk to compute the true 
  distribution (by line integral along each ray).

  See plot-polar-gaussian.sh to plot the true distribution
  and some candidate approximation formulas.

  Eventually gave up and just reduced the weight of each 
  gradient by the factor {g^2/(g^2 + n^2)} where
  {g} is the gradient modulus and {n} is the specified
  noise deviation.

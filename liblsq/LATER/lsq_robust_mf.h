  /* Similar to {lsq_array_fit} from {lsq_array.h}, but after an initial
    least squares fit, applies an iterative method that (hopefully)
    identifies exceptionally bad data points, and reduces their effect.
    
    The parameter {maxiter} is the number of adjustment iterations; if
    zero, the procedure is equivalent to {lsq_fit_arrays}.
    
    The procedure assumes that each data point {xi,fi} (each pair of
    rows from {X} and {F}) may be one of two kinds, /inlier/ or
    /outlier/. An inlier point is assumed to be the current
    approximation {U * xi}, plus an error with a multivariate Gaussian
    probability distribution. An outlier is assumed to have a
    broader distribution, independent of the current approximation.
    
    Before each corrective iteration, the procedure computes a vector
    {P[0..nt-1]} such that {P[i]} is the estimated probability that
    data point {i} is an outlier. It also computes the average and
    covariance matrices of the inlier errors and of the outlier values,
    based on the currently fitted matrix {U}. The matrix {U} is then
    recomputed as if the actual weight of each datum {i} were
    {W[i]*(1-P[i])}.  !!! Check whether {P} is inlier or outlier. !!! 
    
    If {report} is not null, at each iteration the procedure calls
    {report(iter,U,Fc,P)} before each correcting iteration.
    
    !!! Must prove that it converges. !!!
    
    !!! Describe {K,L} !!!
    
    If {K}, {L}, and/or {P} are null, the procedure allocates them
    internally and discards them before returning. */

  /* Computes the averages and covariances of {nt} vectors of 
    sample values of {nt} variables, for inliers ({good=TRUE}) or outliers
    ({good=FALSE}), and estimated `a priori' probability of a data record
    being good or bad, respectively.

    The array {Y} must have {nt} rows and {nf} columns, linearized by
    rows. The vectors {W} and {P} must have {nt} elements. For each {k}
    in {0..nt-1}, and each {j} in {0..nf-1}, the procedure assumes that
    {Y[nf*k + j]} is the value of variable {j} associated to data record {k},
    {W[k]} is the relevance weight of that data record, and {P[k]} is the
    current probability of that data record being a good one (`inlier').
    ??? Or is it `outlier'? ???
    
    When {good} is true, the {Y} matrix should contain the residuals of
    the independent variables (the sampled values minus the fitted model
    values). The effective weight of data record {k} will be
    {W[k]*P[k]}.
    
    When {good} is false, the {Y} matrix shoudl contain the
    sampled values of the independent variables, and the effective
    weight of data record {k} will be {W[k]*(1-P[k])}.
    
    The argument {Verf} is used only when {good} is false, and must be the largest 
    principal variance of the inlier distribution.  It is used to ensure that 
    the outlier distribution is wider than the inlier one. 
    
    If {W} is null, assumes {w[k]==1.0} for all {k}.
    If {P} is null, assumes {p[k]==0.5} for all {k}.
    
    The array {E} must have {nf} elements.  The procedure reeturns in {E[j]} the average 
    value of variable {j} (that is, {Y[k*nf + j]}).  
    
    The procedure returns also in {K}, which must be an {nf} by {nf} matrix, 
    the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the variables 
    specified in the {Y} matrix.  These eigenvectors are the principal directions of the joint distribution
    of those variables. The variances of those variables along those principal directions are returned in the 
    {L} vector}, which must be an {nf}-element vector.  If {K}, {L}, or {P} are null, they are allocated
    internally and then discarded.
    
    Finally, the procedure returns 
    in {*priP} (if not null) the estimated probability of 
    a data record belonging to the selectd class, which is
    the weighted mean of {P[0..nt-1]} or its complement, depending on {good}. */

    The good data records (inliers) and the bad samples (outliers) are
    assumed to have multivariate normal distributions. The arrays
    {E_gud,E_bad} must have {nf} elements, the expected values of the
    {F} variables for inliers and outliers, respectively; {K_gud,K_bad}
    must be {nf} by {nf} matrices, whose rows are the orthonormal
    eigenvector bases (principal directions) extracted from the
    covariance matrices; and {L_gud,L_bad} must be the corresponding
    eigenvalues (variances along the principal axes).
    
    Note that for good values the expected values {E_gud} must include
    the fitted formula values for the same independent variables as {F}.

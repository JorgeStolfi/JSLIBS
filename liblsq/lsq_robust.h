  /* Similar to {lsq_array_fit} from {lsq_array.h}, with {nf} set to 1;
    except that, after an initial least squares fit, it applies an
    iterative method that (hopefully) identifies exceptionally bad data
    points, and reduces their effect.

    The parameter {maxiter} is the number of adjustment iterations; if
    zero, the procedure is equivalent to {lsq_fit_arrays}.

    The procedure assumes that each data point {X[k*nx+{0..nx-1}],F[k]},
    may be one of two kinds, /inlier/ or /outlier/. 
    
    The function sample {F[k]} of an inlier point is assumed to be the true linear
    function of the arguments, plus an error with a Gaussian probability
    distribution that has zero mean and deviation {dev_gud/sqrt(W[k])},
    for some unknown parameter {dev_gud}.
    
    An outlier is assumed to have a broader Gaussian distribution, whose
    mean {avg_bad} is unknown but independent of the current approximation
    and of the index {k}, and whose deviation is {dev_bad/Wk}, for some
    unnown {dev_bad}.

    The procedure first computes an initial coefficient matrix {U} with
    plain weighted least squares, and with it computes an initial
    approximation value {S[k] = (X*U)[k]}} for each data point, and sets
    {P[k] = 0.5}. Then it performs up to {maxiter} corrective
    iterations. At each iteration, the procedure estimates the
    parameters {dev_gud,avg_bad,dev_bad} of the inlier and outlier
    distributions, based on the current values of {S,F,P}. With those
    parameters and the values {F[k]} and {S[k]}, it (re)computes {P[k]},
    the estimated probability that data point {k} is an inlier. Finally
    it recomputes the coefficient vector {U} by weighted least squares,
    but substituting the function sample {F[k]} by an adjusted sample
    {Fc[k]} that is {F[k]} if {P[k]} is 1, {S[k]} if {P[k]} is 0, and
    the linear interpolation of the two for other values of {P[k]}

    If {report} is not null, at each iteration the procedure calls
    {report(iter,P,Fc,U)} before each correcting iteration.
    
    Note that only the relative values of the weights are relevant. A
    data point with zero weight is ignored. Moreover, for any integer
    {N}, a data point that has weight {Wk} counts the same as {N} data
    points with same arguments and function samples, but with weight
    {Wk/N}.

    !!! Must prove that it converges. !!!

    If {P} is null, the procedure allocates it internally and discards
    it before returning. */

    values {Y[0..nt-1]}, for inliers ({inlier=TRUE})
    or outliers ({inlier=FALSE}). Also returns in {*priP} the estimated
    `a priori' probability of data point {k} being inlier or
    outlier, respectively.

    The vectors {W} and {P} must have {nt} elements. For each {k} in
    {0..nt-1}, the procedure assumes that {W[k]} is the original
    relevance weight of data point {k}, and {P[k]} is the current
    probability of that data point being an inlier.

    When {inlier} is true, each {Y[k]} should be the current residual of the
    data point {k} (the original function sample {F[k]} minus the
    current fitted model value {S[k]}). The effective weight of point {k} in the
    least squares fitting will be {W[k]*P[k]}. Although the mean {*avgP}
    is computed normally, the deviation {*devP} is computed assuming
    that the mean is zero (as it should if {Y} are the residuals from
    plain weighted least squares).

    ??? Check whether the mean should be considered. ???

    When {inlier} is false, each {Y[k]} must be the original sample
    function sample {F[k]}. The effective weight of data point {k} will
    be {W[k]*(1-P[k])}. In this case the computed deviation {*devP} will
    be relative to the computed mean {*avgP}.

    The argument {dev_ref} is used only when {inlier} is false, and must be the
    deviation of the inlier distribution.  It is used to ensure that
    the outlier distribution is wider than the inlier one.

    If {W} is null, assumes {w[k]==1.0} for all {k}.
    If {P} is null, assumes {p[k]==0.5} for all {k}. */

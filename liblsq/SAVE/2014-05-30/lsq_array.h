  /* Finds the linear function {s} from {R^nx} to {R^nf} that best
    approximates some function {f} from {R^nx} to {R^nf}, over a given
    set of cases (data records), by weighted least squares.
    
    Assumes that the data is given as two matrices {X,F} and a vector
    {W} (instead of a generating procedure {gen_case}, as in {lsq_fit}
    from {lsq.h}). The matrices {X} and {F} should have {nt} rows and
    {nx} or {nf} columns, respectively, linearized by rows; and the
    vector {W} should have {nt} elements. Each datum is therefore {xi[j]
    = X[i*nx + j]} for {j} in {0..nx-1}, {fi[k] = F[i*nf + k]} for {k}
    in {0..nf-1}, and {wi = W[i]}. If {W} is null, assumes unit weights 
    for all arguments.
     
    The matrix {U} should have {nx*nf} elements, interpreted as {nx}
    rows and {nf} columns. The approximation is defined as the
    vector-matrix product {S = X U}. Namely, column {k} of {U} is the
    coefficient vector of the linear combination of {xi[0..nx-1]} that
    best approximates coordinate {k} of the function {fi}, in the sense
    of minimizing the sum of squared errors {|X[i,*] U[*,k] - F[i,k]|^2}
    over all data records {i} in {0..nt-1}.
    
    Returns the rank {r} of the least-squares system. If {r} is less
    than {nx}, it means that the rows of {X} span a proper linear
    subspace of {R^{nx}}. In that case the best-fit map is not unique.
   
    This method uses internal working storage proportional {nx*(nx+nf)},
    like {lsq_fit}.

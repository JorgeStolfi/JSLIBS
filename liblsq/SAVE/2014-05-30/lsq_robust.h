  /* Similar to {lsq_array_fit} from {lsq_array.h}, with {nf} set to 1;
    except that, after an initial least squares fit, it applies an
    iterative method that (hopefully) identifies exceptionally bad data
    points, and reduces their effect.

    The parameter {maxiter} is the number of adjustment iterations; if
    zero, the procedure is equivalent to {lsq_fit_arrays}.

    The procedure assumes that each data point {X[k*nx+{0..nx-1}],F[k]},
    may be one of two kinds, /inlier/ or /outlier/. The value {F[k]} of
    an inlier point is assumed to be the final approximation {(X*U)[k]},
    plus an error with a Gaussian probability distribution. An outlier
    is assumed to have a broader Gaussian distribution, independent of
    the current approximation.

    Before each corrective iteration, the procedure estimates the
    parameters (average and standard deviation) of the inlier and
    outlier distributions, based on the current approximation
    coefficients {U}, and (re)computes the vector {P[0..nt-1]}, setting
    {P[i]} to the estimated probability that data point {i} is an
    inlier. The coefficient vector {U} is then recomputed by weighted
    least squares, as if the actual value {Fc[i]} of each datum was
    {F[i]} if {P[i]} is 1, the current approximation value {Z[i]} if
    {P[i]} is 0, and the linear interpolation of the two for other
    values of {P[i]}

    ??? order of arguments of {report} should be order of computation. ???

    If {report} is not null, at each iteration the procedure calls
    {report(iter,U,Fc,P)} before each correcting iteration.

    !!! Must prove that it converges. !!!

    If {P} is null, the procedure allocates it internally and discards
    it before returning. */

  /* Computes the average {*avgP} and standard deviation {*devP} of {nt}
    values {Y[0..nt-1]}, for inliers ({inlier=TRUE})
    or outliers ({inlier=FALSE}). Also returns in {*priP} the estimated
    `a priori' probability of data point {k} being inlier or
    outlier, respectively.

    The vectors {W} and {P} must have {nt} elements. For each {k} in
    {0..nt-1}, the procedure assumes that {W[k]} is the relevance weight
    of {Y[k]}, and {P[k]} is the current probability of that data point being
    an inlier.

    When {inlier} is true, each {Y[k]} should be the residual of the
    dependent variable (the sampled value minus the fitted model value).
    The effective weight of point {k} in the least squares fitting will
    be {W[k]*P[k]}. Although the mean {*avgP} is computed normally, the
    deviation {*devP} is computed assuming that the mean is zero (as it
    should if {Y} are the deviations from plain least squares).

    ??? Check whether the mean should be considered. ???

    When {inlier} is false, each {Y[k]} must be a value of the dependent
    variable, as given. The effective weight of data point {k} will be
    {W[k]*(1-P[k])}. In this case the computed deviation {*devP} will be
    relative to the computed mean {*avgP}.

    The argument {dev_ref} is used only when {inlier} is false, and must be the
    deviation of the inlier distribution.  It is used to ensure that
    the outlier distribution is wider than the inlier one.

    If {W} is null, assumes {w[k]==1.0} for all {k}.
    If {P} is null, assumes {p[k]==0.5} for all {k}. */

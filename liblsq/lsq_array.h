  /* Finds the linear function {s} from {R^nx} to {R^nf} that best
    approximates some function {f} from {R^nx} to {R^nf}, over a given
    set of data points, by weighted least squares.
    
    Assumes that the data points are given as two matrices {X,F} and a
    vector {W} (instead of a generating procedure {gen_data_point}, as
    in {lsq_fit} from {lsq.h}). The matrices {X} and {F} should have
    {nt} rows and {nx} or {nf} columns, respectively, linearized by
    rows; and the vector {W} should have {nt} elements, interpreted as a
    column. Each data point is therefore {Xk[i] = X[k*nx + i]} for {i}
    in {0..nx-1}, {Fk[j] = F[k*nf + j]} for {j} in {0..nf-1}, and {Wk =
    W[k]}, for {k} in {0..nt-1}. If {W} is null, assumes unit weights
    for all arguments.
    
    The procedure stores into {U} the coefficient matrix of the 
    fitted linear approximation {s}.
    The matrix {U} should have {nx*nf} elements, interpreted as {nx}
    rows and {nf} columns. The approximation is defined as the
    vector-matrix product {S = X U}. Namely, column {j} of {U} is the
    coefficient vector of the linear combination of {Xk[0..nx-1]} that
    best approximates coordinate {j} of the function {Fk}, in the sense
    of minimizing the sum of squared errors {Wk*|X[k,*] U[*,j] - F[k,j]|^2}
    over all data points {k} in {0..nt-1}.
    
    Note that only the relative values of the weights are relevant. A
    data point with zero weight is ignored. Moreover, for any integer
    {N}, a data point that has weight {Wk} counts the same as {N} data
    points with same arguments and function samples, but with weight
    {Wk/N}.
    
    Returns the rank {r} of the least-squares system. If {r} is less
    than {nx}, it means that the rows of {X} span a proper linear
    subspace of {R^{nx}}. In that case, the best-fit map is not unique.
   
    This method uses internal working storage proportional {nx*(nx+nf)},
    like {lsq_fit}.

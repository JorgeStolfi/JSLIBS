/* The procedures in this section require that all file arguments be

  In case of failure (including read or write errors) they print a
  warning to {stderr} and return {cryptoy_ERROR}; otherwise they
  return the number of bytes processed. Output files are flushed with
  {fflush}, but all files are left open. The bits in each byte are
  read or written in big-to-small order (from highest-valued to
  lowest-valued). */

int cryptoy_xor_files(FILE *f0, FILE *f1, FILE *f);
  /* Writes for file {f} the bitwise XOR of the contents of files {f0}
    and {f1}. The files must be properly opened by the caller. Fails
    if file {f0} is longer than file {f1}. */

int cryptoy_bitsplit_file(FILE *f, FILE *k, FILE *f0, FILE *f1);
  /* Reads file {f} and splits it into two files {f0,f1}, bit by bit,
    according to the bits read from the key file {k}. Specifically,
    each bit of {f} goes into {f0} or to {f1} depending on whether the
    corresponding bit of {k} is 0 or 1, respectively. Fails (returning
    {cryptoy_ERROR}) if file {f} is longer than file {k}.
    
    When file {f} is exhausted, the last bytes of file {f0} and {f1}
    may be both partly filled. In that case, the last incomplete byte
    of {f1} is not written, and its bits are appended to the last
    incomplete byte of {f0}, completing it. Thus, the last 1 to 7 bits
    of file {f0} may be inconsistent with the contents of the key file {k}.
    
    This special case does not occur if, for example, every {2*m}
    bytes of {k} contain equal numbers of 0s and 1s, and the
    byte-length of file {f} is a multiple of {2*m}. Then files {f0}
    and {f1} will have the same byte-length, which will be a multiple
    of {m}.
    
    The effect of this procedure can be exactly reversed with
    {cryptoy_bitmerge_files}. */

int cryptoy_bitmerge_files(FILE *f0, FILE *f1, FILE *k, FILE *f);
  /* Reads files {f0} and {f1} and merges them into a single file {f},
    bit by bit, according to the bits read from the key file {k}.
    Specifically, each bit of {f} is copied from {f0} or from {f1}
    depending on whether the corresponding bit of {k} is 0 or 1,
    respectively.
    
    Once either file is exhausted, then the remainder of the other
    file is copied to {f}, ignoring the remainder of the key file {k}.
    May fail (returning {cryptoy_ERROR}) if files {f0} and {f1}
    together are longer than file {k}.
    
    If {f0} and {f1} were created by
    {cryptoy_bitsplit_file(g,k,f0,f1)}, then
    {cryptoy_bitmerge_files(f0,f1,k,f)}, with the same key file {k},
    will succeed and the file {f} will be identical to {g}.
    
    More generally, the operation {cryptoy_bitmerge_files(f0,f1,k,f)}
    can be undone with {cryptoy_bitsplit_file(f,k,g0,g1)} only if the
    lengths of {f0} and {f1} are ``nearly consistent'' with the number
    of zeros and ones in the {k} file. Specifically, if the procedure
    reaches the end of file {f1} when the next bit of file {k} is 1,
    then file {f0} must be exhausted too, or must have at most 7 bits
    left (which, as per above, are copied to {f} ignoring the key
    {k}). In that case, {g0,g1} will be identical to the merged files
    {f0,f1}. In any other case, {cryptoy_bitsplit_file(f,k,g0,g1)}
    will split the trailing bits of {f} incorrectly.
    
    This ``nearly consistent'' condition is always satisfied for files
    {f0,f1} created with {cryptoy_bitsplit_file(f,k,f0,f1)}. It is
    also satisfied if every {2*m} bytes of {k} contain equal numbers
    of 0s and 1s, and {f0,f1} have the same length (in bytes) that is
    divisible by {m}. */

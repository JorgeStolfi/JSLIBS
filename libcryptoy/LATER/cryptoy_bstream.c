    In an input bit stream, the file {f} must be open for 
    reading. The last batch of characters that was read
    from the file {f} is {buf[0..nbuf-1]}. The part of that batch that
    remains to be consumed by the client consists of the HIGHEST
    {nbits} bits (0 to 7) of {C} followed by characters
    {buf[nchars..nbuf-1]}. The remaining {8-nbits} of {C} are zero. If
    {nbits = 0} then {C} is to be loaded from {buf[nchars]}, otherwise
    {nchars} is positive and {C} was taken from {buf[nchars-1]}.
    
    In an output stream, the file {f} must be open for 
    writing. Then {nbuf} is some positive number; the batch of
    data that is to be written to file {f} is bytes {buf[0..nchars-1]}
    followed by the LOWEST {nbits} bits (0 to 7) of {C}. If {nbits =
    0} then {nchars <= nbuf}, otherwise then {nchars < nbuf} and {C},
    when completed, will be stored into {buf[nchars]}. */

Snapshot of J.Stolfi's Affine Arithmetic library,
some auxiliary libraries, and some test programs,
as of 2016-12-28.

The subdirectory structure is more complicated 
than what it should be because it mirrors my 
working environment.  Basically:

  Main libraries:
  
    libaa -- Affine arithmetic library.
    
    libia -- Interval arithmetic library.
    
    libflt -- Floating point tools used by the above.
    
  IA/AA application libraries:
  
    libaagraph -- Tools to plot functions with IA or AA.
    
    libaazf -- Procedures to find zeros of functions with IA or AA.
    
    libaafuncs -- Test functions evaluated with floating point, IA, and AA.
    
  Auxiliary libraries:
    
    libps -- My library of tools to create PS/EPS figures.
    
    libgeo -- My library of linear algebra and analytic geometry.
  
    libjs -- My library of general-purpose routines.

The Makefiles should work in any Linux system (except maybe
for the GL library used in one test program).
If they don't, consider deleting all Makefile and *.make
files and links, and rolling your own makefile.  
The subdirectories should be compiled in the order 
specified by the top-level makefile.

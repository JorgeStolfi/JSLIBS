A LIBRARY FOR UNIVARIATE FUNCTION PLOTS

SUMMARY
  
  This package contains various tools for creating Postscript 
  plots of univariate functions, designed specifically for 
  the arithmetic modules "flt.h", "ia.h", and "aa.h".
  
    fltgraph.h. fltgraph.c
    
      Tools for graphing a Float function of a single Float variable.
      
    iagraph.h, iagraph.c
    
      Tools for plotting functions defined by Interval Arithmetic (IA).

    aagraph.h, aagraph.c
    
      Tools for plotting functions defined by Affine Arithmetic (IA).

    fn1_functions.h, fn1_functions.c
    
      A repertoire of 1-argument functions implemented in
      floating-point, IA and AA.

    fn2_functions.h, fn2_functions.c
    
      A repertoire of 2-argument functions implemented in
      floating-point, IA and AA.

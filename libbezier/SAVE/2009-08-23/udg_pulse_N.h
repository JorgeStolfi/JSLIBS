  N-PULSES
  
  The dyadic N-pulses are defined for any {c \geq -1} and any
  non-negative degree {g \geq 2*c+1}. 
  
  For a given {g} and {c}, there are {g-c} distinct mother pulses
  {w^g_c[pix]}. They fall into two sub-classes:

  * When {pix} is in {c+1..g-c-1}, the mother spline has
    support {(0_1)}, and coincides with the Bernstein-Bézier
    polynomial {BB^g_pix}:

      { w^g_c[pix](z) = BB^g_pix(z) = choose(g,pix) z^{g-pix} (1-z)^pix }

  * When {pix} is in {0..c}, the mother spline is supported on 
    two grid cells, spanning {(0_2)}. In the first cell {(0_1)},
    it can be expressed as a combination of Bernstein-Bézier
    polynomials:
    
      { w^g_c[pix](z) = SUM { choose(k,pix)/2^{k} BB^g_{g-c+k}(z) : k = pix..c } }
    
    For {z} in {(1_2)}, the following relation holds

      { w^g_c[pix](z) = w^g_c[c-pix](2-z) }
      
    so 
      
      { w^g_c[pix](z) = SUM { choose(c-k,pix)/2^{c-k} BB^g_{g-k}(z) : k = 0..c-pix }

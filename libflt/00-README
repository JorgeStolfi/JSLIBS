Tools for multi-model runtime function evaluation

  flt.h, flt.c
  
    Operations on floating-point values that parallel those
    in {ia.h}, {aa.h}.
    
  fltasm.c
  
    Machine-dependent implementation of rounding-mode
    functions for {flt.h}.
  
  pcode.h, pcode.c 
  
    Parses a simple pseudocode representation of 
    algebraic formulas.  Useful for function plotters,
    geometric modeling, testing arithmetic libraries, etc..
    
  flteval.h, flteval.c
  
    Evaluates the pseudocode of an algebraic expression
    with floating point (round-to-nearest mode), as well 
    as its derivatives.
    
  expr-to-pcode, expr-to-pcode.lsp

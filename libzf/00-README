UNIVARIATE ZERO FINDERS USING IA / AA

SUMMARY

  This package contains procedures that find
  all zeros of functions, using validated
  evaluators (IA and AA).
  
    zf.h, zf.c
    
      Enumerates all zeros of an univariate function using general
      enclosures (box, slab, trapezoid, butterfly) which can be
      computed with IA or AA.

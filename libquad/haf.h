/* THE HALF-EDGE STRUCTURE 

  The half-edge data structure is used to encode the topology of a
  two-dimensional /mesh/, namely a subdivision of a two-dimensional
  compact topological manifold (the mesh's /surface/) into a finite
  number of /elements/, which are open topological disks (the /faces/)
  open topological segments (the /edges/) and points (the /vertices/),
  with certain incidence and adjacency conditions. 
  
  The manifold is supposed to be oriented, meaning that at each point
  there is a defined "positive" or "counterclockwise" sense of turning,
  that can be continuously transported over each connected component of
  the manifold without contradiction.
  
  An /arc/ of the mesh is an edge in a specific orientation. The two
  arcs of the same edge are said to be /opposite/ of each other. The
  (/oriented/) /border/ of each face is a circular list of alternating
  arcs and vertices, where each arc is oriented in the direction that
  matches counterclockwise turning on the face. Each arc may appear only
  once in this list, and only on one face (but an arc and its opposite may
  both appear on the same face).
  
  The half-edge structure consists of /arc records/, each representing,
  by definition, one arc of the mesh. The structure defines two
  fundamental /walking operators/ on ac records, {.sym} and {.lnext}.
  The {.sym} operator is an involution of set of all arc records, with
  no fixed points: {a.sym != a} and {a.sym.sym = a} for every arc {a}. The
  records {a} and {a.sym} are interpreted as the oppositely oriented
  arcs on the same edge of the mesh.
  
  The {.lnext} operator is an arbirary permutation of the arc records,
  meaning that {a.lnext != b.lnext} if {a != b}. Each cycle of this
  permutation is interpreted as the list of arcs on the border of a face
  of the mesh.
  
  The {.oprev} operator is defined as the composition {.sym.lnext},
  applied in that order. Each cycle of {.oprev} corresponds to a unique
  vertex of the mesh, and consists of the arcs that leave that vertex,
  in /clockwise/ order around the vertex. Again, an arc {a} may appear
  only once in only one of these cycles; but {a} and {a.sym} may both
  appear on the same cycle, signifying that the corresponding edge is a
  loop with both endpoints on the same vertex.
  
  Several other walking operators can be defined in terms of these, such as
  {.lprev}, {.onext}, {.rnext}, {.rprev}, {.dprev}, {.dnext}. See below.
  
  Each arc record {a} also contains a non-negative integer /arc id/
  {a.aid} that can be chosen by the client of this interface. The arc
  ids of {a} and {a.sym} are always {2*a.eid} and {2*a.eid+1} or
  vice-versa, where {a.eid=a.sym.eid} is a client-chosen id number for
  the underlying undirected edge. The integers {a.aid} and {a.eid} can
  be used as indices in external tables to attach arbitrary properties
  to each arc or edhe of the mesh.
  
  The half-edge data structure proper has no explicit records for faces
  and vertices. Clients of this interface who need to attach properties
  to those elements of the mesh (such as vertex coordinates or face
  geometry) may define their own data records for them. In that case,
  they should probably set up tables {left[a.aid]} that gives the record
  for the face that has {a} on its border, and/or {org[a.aid]} for the
  record of the vertex that is the origin of arc {a}. See {haf_enum_faces}
  and {haf_enum_vertices} below. */

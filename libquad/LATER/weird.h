/* THE WEIRD STRUCTURE 

  The /weird/ data structure, inspired on Weiler's "radia edge"
  structure, is meant to encode the topology and geometry of a /mesh/ consisting of a
  finite number of /elements/ which are open polygons (the /faces/) open
  straight line segments (the /edges/), and points (the /vertices/).
  with certain incidence and adjacency conditions.
  
  TOPOLOGY: FLAGS AND FLAG OPERATORS
  
  The topology part of a weird structure {W} is a quintuple {T(W) =
  (F,.sym,.enext,.fnext)} where {F = F(W)} is a finite set -- the
  /flags/ of {W} -- and {.sym}, {.enext}, and {.fnext} --
  the /operators/ of {W} -- are permutations of {F}, with properties
  specified below.
  
  The {.enext} and {.fnext} operators may be arbitrary permutations of
  the flags. Their inverses will be denoted {.eprev}, and {.fprev},
  respectively. The {.sym} operator must be a proper involution (meaning
  that {f.sym != f} and {f.sym.sym = f} for any flag {f}), and it must
  satisfy the properties {.enext.sym} = {.sym.eprev} and {.fnext.sym =
  .sym.fprev}. It folows that {sym.enext = .eprev.sym} and {.sym.fnext =
  .fprev.sym} and {.sym.vnext = .vprev.sym}.
  
  (The topology can be seen as derived from a /3-G-map/ as defined by
  Lienhardt [1a] and Guedes [1b], where {.sym} is the operator
  {\phi_0\phi_3}, {.fnext} is {\phi_0\phi_1}, and {.enext} is
  {\phi_2\phi_3}. This in turn is a special case of the GEM
  (graph-encoded manifold) structure described and studied by Lins [2];
  which is a special case of the GEM structure defined by Montagner and
  Stolfi [3]. See also to the facet-edge structure of Laslo and Dobkin
  [4].
  
  More specifically, the topology of a weird structure is derived
  from an *orientable* 3-G-map, whose operator graph is
  bipartite. In this case every G-map operator swiches side of the
  bipartition, whereas the composite operators of the weird structure
  stay on the same side. Then the flags {F} of the weird structure are
  just one side of the bipartition.)
  
  (Just as we can go from the quad-edge structure to the oct-edge structure,
  we could replace {F} by two copies {F+,F-}, with {.sym}, {.enext}, and {.fnext}
  and add a fifth operator {.flip} to the weird structure with the
  requirement that {.op.flip = .flip.op^{-1}} for every operator {op} among the 
  other three.  How it relates to the other four is to be defined.)
  
  RINGS AND STARS
    
  Each topological operator {.op} of theweird structure  determines a partition of the flags into
  one or more orbits, each orbit consisting of {f.op^k} for every
  integer {k}.
    
  The orbits of {.sym} are pairs of flags.  Each pair is called a /topological edge/
    
  Each orbit of {.fnext} 
  
  
  But
  {f.cflip.enext^k = f.eprev^k.cflip}; because of W7, the orbits of {f}
  and {f.cflip} are disjoint.
  
  Similarly, let's define {.fnext = .vflip.eflip}; its inverse {.fprev} will be {.eflip.vflip}.
  
  Also let's define {.vnext = .fflip.eflip}; its inverse {.vprev} will be {.eflip.fflip}.
  
  A weird structure is reqired to satisfy two more topological axioms:
    
    W8. For any {f} and any {k}, {f.enext^k = (f(.vflip.eflip)^k} is distinct from {f.cflip}.

  TOPOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION
  
  A weird data structure {W} can be interpreted as a topological space
  {T(S}} as follows:
  
    For each quad {q} of {W}, choose one flag {f(q)} to be its /base flag/
    Any flag {g} in {q} can be specified by a pair of bits {o,r} such that 
    {g = f(q).vflip^o.cflip^r = f(q).cflip^r.vflip^o}. This bit pair is the /orientation/
    of the flag {g} (with respect to the chosen base flag of its quad).  Then we can denote 
    flag {g} by {q[o,r]}.
    
    For each quad {q} of {W}, define {T(q)} to be a copy of the triangle
    {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)} of {\RR^2}.
    
    For any quad {q} and any orientation {o,r}, let {q'[o',r']} be the 
    flag {q[o,r].eflip}. 
    
  GEOMETRY: 
  
  A flag
  can  be imagined as 
  arcs of the same edge are said to be /opposite/ of each other. The
  (/oriented/) /border/ of each face is a circular list of alternating
  arcs and vertices, where each flag is oriented in the direction that
  matches counterclockwise turning on the face. Each flag may appear only
  once in this list, and only on one face (but an flag and its opposite may
  both appear on the same face).
  
  The half-edge structure consists of /flag records/, each representing,
  by definition, one flag of the mesh. The structure defines two
  fundamental /walking operators/ on ac records, {.cflip} and {.lnext}.
  The {.cflip} operator is an involution of set of all flag records, with
  no fixed points: {a.cflip != a} and {a.cflip.cflip = a} for every flag {a}. The
  records {a} and {a.cflip} are interpreted as the oppositely oriented
  arcs on the same edge of the mesh.
  
  The {.lnext} operator is an arbirary permutation of the flag records,
  meaning that {a.lnext != b.lnext} if {a != b}. Each cycle of this
  permutation is interpreted as the list of arcs on the border of a face
  of the mesh.
  
  The {.oprev} operator is defined as the composition {.cflip.lnext},
  applied in that order. Each cycle of {.oprev} corresponds to a unique
  vertex of the mesh, and consists of the arcs that leave that vertex,
  in /clockwise/ order around the vertex. Again, an flag {a} may appear
  only once in only one of these cycles; but {a} and {a.cflip} may both
  appear on the same cycle, signifying that the corresponding edge is a
  loop with both endpoints on the same vertex.
  
  Several other walking operators can be defined in terms of these, such as
  {.lprev}, {.onext}, {.rnext}, {.rprev}, {.dprev}, {.dnext}. See below.
  
  Each flag record {a} also contains a non-negative integer /flag id/
  {a.aid} that can be chosen by the client of this interface. The flag
  ids of {a} and {a.cflip} are always {2*a.eid} and {2*a.eid+1} or
  vice-versa, where {a.eid=a.cflip.eid} is a client-chosen id number for
  the underlying undirected edge. The integers {a.aid} and {a.eid} can
  be used as indices in external tables to attach arbitrary properties
  to each flag or edhe of the mesh.
  
  The half-edge data structure proper has no explicit records for faces
  and vertices. Clients of this interface who need to attach properties
  to those elements of the mesh (such as vertex coordinates or face
  geometry) may define their own data records for them. In that case,
  they should probably set up tables {left[a.aid]} that gives the record
  for the face that has {a} on its border, and/or {org[a.aid]} for the
  record of the vertex that is the origin of flag {a}. See {weird_enum_faces}
  and {weird_enum_vertices} below. */

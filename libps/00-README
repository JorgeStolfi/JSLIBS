A LIBRARY FOR CREATING POSTSCRIPT FILES

SUMMARY
  
  This package contains various tools for creating Postscript files,
  with emphasis on graphics as opposed to text.  Modules:
  
    pswr.h, pswr.c  

      The basic module. Still somewhat limited (no tilted text, no
      ellipses, no transformations, equal scales, etc.) A complete
      rewrite is in the works elsewhere (see the "libpsplot" package).
    
    pswr_def.h, pswr_aux.h

      Internal definitions for "pswr". 
    
    pswr_vis.h, pswr_vis.c

      A window clipping module used internally by "pswr". 

    pswr_iso.h, pswr_iso.c 

      An extension of "pswr". Contains additional tools for generating
      isoline and color-band plots of bivariate functions.

    pswr_color.h, pswr_color.c 

      Tools for generating color scales suitable for printing.

    ps.h, ps.c

      An older version of "pswr", with a clumsier and even more limited
      interface. It ought to be retired but it is still used by many
      programs. At present (sep/2003) it is just a thin layer on top of
      "pswr".

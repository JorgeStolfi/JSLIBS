A LIBRARY FOR CREATING ENCAPSULATED POSTSCRIPT FILES

SUMMARY
  
  This package contains various tools for creating Encapsulated Postscript files,
  with emphasis on graphics as opposed to text.  Modules:
  
    epswr.h, epswr.c  

      The basic module. Still somewhat limited (no tilted text, no
      ellipses, no transformations, equal scales, etc.) A complete
      rewrite is in the works elsewhere (see the "libpsplot" package).
    
    epswr_def.h, epswr_aux.h

      Internal definitions for "epswr". 
    
    epswr_vis.h, epswr_vis.c

      A window clipping module used internally by "pswr". 

    epswr_iso.h, epswr_iso.c 

      An extension of "pswr". Contains additional tools for generating
      isoline and color-band plots of bivariate functions.

    epswr_color.h, epswr_color.c 

      Tools for generating color scales suitable for printing.

    received from all its input synapses betwen time {t} and time {t+1}
    is a normal random variable with mean {DV_avg} and deviation
    {DV_dev}. This potential increment includes the pulses {X[j,t]} of

    includes the external input signal {I[i,t]}. This potential
    increment should not be modulated by the firing gain {G[i,t]} of

  /* Appends to the vector {net->syn[0..ns-1]} a number of random synapses
    from neurons {ia_0..ia_1} to neurons {ib_0..ib_1}.
    
    On input, the variable {net->ns} must contain the number {ns}
    of previously defined synapses. On output, it will be incremented
    with the number of synapses created by the function call. The
    vector {net->syn} must be allocated before the call (even if
    with zero size) and will be extended by the function if and when needed.
    
    The parameter {pr} is basically the probability of adding a synapse
    between any neuron {ia} in {ia0..ia1} and any neuron {ib} in {ib0..ib1}.
    In particular, if {pr} is zero, no synapses are added and the call is
    a no-op.  
    
    If {pr} is positive, usually at most one synapse is added, with
    probability {pr}, for each of those pairs {ia,ib}. Then the number
    of synapses added by the call is a random variable with binomial
    distribution, max value {na*nb} and mean value {pr*na*nb} where
    {na = ia1-ia0+1} and {nb = ib1-ib0+1}. On average, the call will
    increment the output degree of each neuron in {ia0..ia1} by
    {pr*nb} synapses, and the input degree of each neuron in
    {ib0..ib1} by {pr*na} synapses.
    
    Exceptionally, if this process gives zero new synapses to a neuron
    {ib}, but {pr} is not zero, one synapse is added anyway, from a
    neuron {ia} randomly chosen among {ia0..ia1}. Thus, if {pr} is not
    zero, the procedure always adds at least {nb} synapses. This
    exceptional case is unlikely to occur if {pr*na} is substantially
    greater than 1.
    
    The weights of the added synapses will have a log-normal
    distribution. Specifically, the log {zwt} of the absolute weight
    will be a random variable with normal distribution.  The
    sign of the weight will be the same as that of {swt_tot_avg}.
    
    The mean {zavg} and deviation {zdev} of the log-weight {zwt} will
    be chosen so that the SUM of the weights of the synapses entering
    each neuron {ib} in {ib0..ib1} is a random variable with mean
    {swt_tot_avg} and deviation {swt_tot_dev}. In particular, if
    {swt_tot_dev} is zero, every new synapse entering {ib} will have
    the same weight {swt = swt_tot_avg/din} where {din} is the number
    of new input synapses added to {ib}. */

  An {nmsim_stats_t} record can be computed incrementally by calling

  more times (once for each sample), then {nmsim_stats_finalize} just
  once. Between initialization and finalization, the fields {.avg} and {.dev}
  are temporarily used to hold the sum of samples and the sum of their
  squares, respetively. */

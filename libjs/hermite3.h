double hermite3_interp(double v0, double d0, double v1, double d1, double a, double b, double t);
  /* Hermite interpolation at some point {t} in the interval {[a _ b]},
    given the values {v0,v1} and the derivatives {d0,d1}
    at the two ends of that interval. */

void hermite3_subsample(int nx, double x[], double dx[], int ns, int ny, double y[]);
  /* Upsamples the sample sequence {x[0..nx-1]} with {ns} steps in each unit interval,
    and stores the result in {y[0..ny-1]}.  Requires {nx>0}, {ns>0}, and 
    {ny == ns*(nx-1)+1}.
    
    Namely, sets {y[i*ns]} to {x[i]} for {i} in {0..nx-1}, and fills the
    other elements {y[k]}, for every {k} in {0..ny-1} that is not
    multiple of {ns}, using a C1 cubic Hermite interpolator. 
    
    If {dx} is not {NULL}, the interpolator assumes that {dx[0..nx-1]} are 
    the derivatives of the function corresponding to the values {x[0..nx-1]}.
    If {dx} is {NULL}, the procedure uses internal estimates of the derivatives
    by {hermite3_estimate_deriv}, that are accurate if the sampled 
    function is any cubic polynomial.  */

    samples, at equal unit steps, are {x[0..nx-1]}. The 
    estimatives are accurate if the sampled function is any cubic polynomial.
    
    More precisely, if {nx >= 4} the procedure computes the derivative at
    each input sample with {hermite3_estimate_deriv_2_0_2}, except at
    samples {0} and {n-1}, where it uses {hermite3_estimate_deriv_0_1_3}
    and at samples {1} and {n-2}, where it uses {hermite3_estimate_deriv_1_1_2}.
    
    As special cases, it estimates the derivatives by fitting a parabola if {nx == 3},
    an affinity if {nx == 2}, and a constant if {nx == 1}..
    
    Uses {hermite3_estimate_deriv_0_3} for samples {0} and {ny-1},
    {hermite3_estimate_deriv_1_2} for samples {1} and {ny-2},
    and {hermite3_estimate_deriv_2_2} for all the other samples. */
